everything else we need to learn Java labguage.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-jdk-jre-jvm/ - Java program is compiled by compiler and we get java bytecode. Java bytecode is
a understandable code for java interpreter(JVM), compiler is computer software that transforms computer code written in one programming
language (the source language) into another programming language (the target language). A Java compiler is a compiler for the programming
language Java. The most common form of output from a Java compiler is Java class files containing platform-neutral Java bytecode.
For Java it has a dedicated compiler called Javac. Javac Compiles your Java code into Bytecode. And then we have the JVM which uses that 
bytecode to convert it to machine code, JIT (just-in-time) compiler inside JVM do this conversion. Machine code is code in machine language
that is in the form of binary (0,1) is computer language that is directly understandable by a computer's CPU (central processing unit), and
it is the language into which all programs must be converted before they can be run. If you are wondering how CPU executes and understands
instruction in machine level language that is 0 and 1, it happens through transistors which are either ON(read as 1) or OFF (read as 0).
